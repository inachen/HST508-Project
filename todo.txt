TADs
- process matrix to give parameters (L, R, L+R, etc) for each bin
    - find a good cut off for poor-read columns
    - find a good window (50bp on either side)
    - other parameters (L, R, L+R, switch, |L-R|)
    - graph
- good algorithm to organize bins into x number of groups
    - 
- spectral clustering
- tads are different in A and B compartments
    - how do we do this?
